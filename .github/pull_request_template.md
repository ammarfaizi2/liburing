<summary>Click to show/hide commit message format rules</summary>

## Commit message format rules:
1. The first line is title (don't be more than 72 chars if possible).
2. Then an empty line.
3. Then a description (may be omitted for trivial changes).
4. Then an empty line again (if it has a description).
5. Then a Signed-off-by tag with your name and email. For example:
```
Signed-off-by: Foo Bar <foo.bar@gmail.com>
```

Description should be word-wrapped at 72 chars. Some things should not
be word-wrapped. They may be some kind of quoted text - long compiler
error messages, oops reports, Link, etc. (things that have a certain
specific format).

If the commit is a fix for an issue, add a `Fixes` tag to the issue
link.

To make the maintainer easily filter pull request from the email
notification, use `[GIT PULL]` as a prefix in your PR title.
```
[GIT PULL] Your Pull Request Title
```

## Commit message example:
```
src/queue: don't flush SQ ring for new wait interface

If we have IORING_FEAT_EXT_ARG, then timeouts are done through the
syscall instead of by posting an internal timeout. This was done
to be both more efficient, but also to enable multi-threaded use
the wait side. If we touch the SQ state by flushing it, that isn't
safe without synchronization.
